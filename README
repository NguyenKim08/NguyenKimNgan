Hello, my name is Nguyen Kim Ngan. And here is my place where I share my journey as a college student at L1 info at Paris 8.

"Mon année de L1 info" is where I share all my codes/solutions to all the exercices I've done throughout the year, no matter how simple is it, it's fun to see my progession slowly. 
The exerices are varied from Dr.Racket, Python, C and as you will never expected Godot, yup. (Although, my Godot skills aren't that great to be honest)

"Advent of code 2025" is where I participe a fun challenge named Advent of code which happens every year.
